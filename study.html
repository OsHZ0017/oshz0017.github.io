          <h1>Study Motivation</h1>
          <p>
            If you had asked me years ago what my motivation was to get into the
            field of ICT, back when I was maybe 10 years old, I would have
            told you that it was because it is what my dad does. Since then, I have
            learnt a little better why I actually care about this field and am
            interested in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Computers have always interested me. Partially because my dad worked
            as a teacher teaching ICT, partially because they just seem so
            blatantly complex. It nearly seems magical. As a kid, I
            wondered how you would even learn to write all the code that goes
            into a functional computer. I often still wonder.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also learnt I can learn that language, though. I can learn to
            write that code. Not very many people are able to write it, but I can learn
            to. It would be super cool if I did learn that language!
          </p>
          <p>
            I would feel so incredibly proud of myself if I managed to finish this
            course. If I could create things like the websites I use every day or even
            create something better. A product I want to use because I actually
            prefer it over whatever was the standard before I made it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Networks too. I want to learn to make the highways that people use
            for this digital communication. I want to not only drive on them,
            but understand the road signs. I want to design the pathways and build the
            lanes. I think I can learn those things if I follow, and finish,
            this course.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up, I even learnt my dad does not know how to code. He is a
            coach for the ICT course, I have already surpassed his knowledge.
