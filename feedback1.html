          <h1>PCO Feedback</h1>
          <p>
            Throughout this year and for this project, we are - and will be -
            receiving a lot of feedback. Taking that feedback and improving upon
            it is a major part of the course and something we will learn to do.
            Additionally, we will learn to give constructive criticism, feedback
            you can actually work with. Here is some of the feedback I have
            received so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I came to the front of the class, I have received a little
            feedback on my site already. I will work through these comments and
            provide motivation or insight to changes, or lack thereof.
          </p>
          <h5>The website folder was nested too far into the repository.</h5>
          <p>
            I’ve fixed this by un-nesting the files on the date of posting. I
            intend to figure out a way to sort files the way I want to sort them
            as well as have them un-nested in the repository in the future.
            Although it’s not a main project of mine since it’s not a part of
            official requirements and. For now, everything is sorted
            functionally.
          </p>
          <h5>Fix capitalized letters in file names</h5>
          <p>
            After this comment, I went and checked all my files and folders
            within the repository to ensure no capitalization was present. I’ve
            fixed the issue.
          </p>
          <h5>Add content to the Blog and Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
          <p>
            Since receiving this comment, I’ve been working very hard to collect
            and fulfill all the page requirements for the different pages on
            this website. You can now find the FAQ filled in entirely, and the
            blog being actively worked on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally I gave myself some feedback on a bit of JavaScript I
            wrote, and added a feature to my Dashboard that compares the amount
            of gained credits to the NBSA to determine whether or not I’ve
            passed it. In the future I’d like to also add a feature where the
            Dashboard locally saves the last calculated amount of EC’s, but this
            is no priority.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another feature I learnt about but haven't yet implemented, is a CSS
            grid. With the current timecrunch, it's not a realistic thing to
            implement before friday. However, I do hope to add it before the
            interviews in October happen.
          </p>
