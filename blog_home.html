                <h1>Study Motivation</h1>
                <p>
                  If you had asked me years ago what my motivation was to get into the
                  field of ICT, back when I was maybe 10 years old, I would have
                  told you that it was because it is what my dad does. Since then, I have
                  learnt a little better why I actually care about this field and am
                  interested in it.

                <h1>SWOT analysis</h1>
                <p>
                  We all had to fill in a SWOT analysis as a part of the application
                  process. A SWOT analysis works you through a series of questions to
                  determine your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.
                  This allows you to figure out in what regards you are already very strong and in
                  what regards you could grow to improve.

                <p>
                  Personally, I haven’t got a lot of experience in the world of
                  coding. I’ve had my funks of curiosity, exploring pages like
                  <a href="http://www.code.org">code.org</a> and similar, but I’ve
                  never sunk my teeth into any sort of major projects or languages
                  beyond HTML and CSS.

                <h1>PCO Feedback</h1>
                <p>
                  Throughout this year and for this project, we are - and will be -
                  receiving a lot of feedback. Taking that feedback and improving upon
                  it is a major part of the course and something we will learn to do.
                  Additionally, we will learn to give constructive criticism, feedback
                  you can actually work with. Here is some of the feedback I have
                  received so far.
