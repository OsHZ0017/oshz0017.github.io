                        <p>
                            If you had asked me years ago what my motivation was
                            to get into the field of ICT, back when I was maybe
                            10 years old, I would have told you that it was
                            because it is what my dad does. Since then, I have
                            learnt a little better why I actually care about
                            this field and am interested in it.

                        <h1>SWOT analysis</h1>
                        <p>
                            We all had to fill in a SWOT analysis as a part of
                            the application process. A SWOT analysis works you
                            through a series of questions to determine your
                            Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.
                            This allows you to figure out in what regards you
                            are already very strong and in what regards you
                            could grow to improve.

                        <p>
                            Personally, I haven’t got a lot of experience in the
                            world of coding. I’ve had my funks of curiosity,
                            exploring pages like
                            <a href="http://www.code.org">code.org</a> and
                            similar, but I’ve never sunk my teeth into any sort
                            of major projects or languages beyond HTML and CSS.

                        <p>
                            Throughout this year and for this project, we are -
                            and will be - receiving a lot of feedback. Taking
                            that feedback and improving upon it is a major part
                            of the course and something we will learn to do.
                            Additionally, we will learn to give constructive
                            criticism, feedback you can actually work with. Here
                            is some of the feedback I have received so far.
