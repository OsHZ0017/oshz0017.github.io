                        <h1>SWOT analysis</h1>
                        <p>
                            We all had to fill in a SWOT analysis as a part of
                            the application process. A SWOT analysis works you
                            through a series of questions to determine your
                            Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.
                            This allows you to figure out in what regards you
                            are already very strong and in what regards you
                            could grow to improve.
                        </p>
                        <h5>I have edited my answers into a cohesive text.</h5>
                        <p>
                            Some of my strengths are that I am curious and
                            unafraid to dive into endeavors that intrigue me. If
                            something manages to grab my interest, I will pour
                            my heart soul and full energy into it, until
                            something occurs to divert that focus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, if I lose my interest, my energy will
                            become incredibly distracted and possibly apathetic
                            towards the subject. A definitive weakness of mine
                            is being unable to find interest or curiosity in a
                            specific subject and falling prey to boredom,
                            disinterest and/or annoyance. It takes a lot of
                            energy to finish things I don't really want to do.
                            For example, it took forever to go sit down to write
                            this blog, simply because I didn't feel like it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are definitely a lot of opportunities for
                            growth in those regards, especially the focus, I
                            want to be better at all of that. I want to teach
                            myself how to find the energy to do things even when
                            they aren’t new and shiny. If I manage to overcome
                            that hurdle I truly do believe I can learn a lot in
                            this course and create things I can be proud of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, I believe my biggest threat would
                            be overloading myself and not setting boundaries,
                            and taking on too many cool projects but ignoring
                            basic requirements. That’s why writing these blogs
                            was left for last, and why it’s a bit of a pitfall.
                        </p>
                        <h5>All in all,</h5>
                        <p>
                            I am perfectly human with room for growth, and hope
                            I do grow over the course of the four years I will
                            spend in this program. I hope to become a diligent
                            student.
                        </p>
