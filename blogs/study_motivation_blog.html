                        <h1>Study Motivation</h1>
                        <p>
                            If you had asked me years ago what my motivation was
                            to get into the field of ICT, back when I was maybe
                            10 years old, I would have told you that it was
                            because it is what my dad does. Since then, I have
                            learnt a little better why I actually care about
                            this field and am interested in it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Computers have always interested me. Partially
                            because my dad worked as a teacher teaching ICT,
                            partially because they just seem so blatantly
                            complex. It nearly seems magical. As a kid, I
                            wondered how you would even learn to write all the
                            code that goes into a functional computer. I often
                            still wonder.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have also learnt I can learn that language,
                            though. I can learn to write that code. Not very
                            many people are able to write it, but I can learn
                            to. It would be super cool if I did learn that
                            language!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would feel so incredibly proud of myself if I
                            managed to finish this course. If I could create
                            things like the websites I use every day or even
                            create something better. A product I want to use
                            because I actually prefer it over whatever was the
                            standard before I made it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Networks too. I want to learn to make the highways
                            that people use for this digital communication. I
                            want to not only drive on them, but understand the
                            road signs. I want to design the pathways and build
                            the lanes. I think I can learn those things if I
                            follow, and finish, this course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Growing up, I even learnt my dad does not know how
                            to code. He is a coach for the ICT course, I have
                            already surpassed his knowledge.
