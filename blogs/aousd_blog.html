                            ”Last year, Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, and
                            NVIDIA announced the Alliance for OpenUSD, an
                            organization to advance and proliferate the USD file
                            format as the future standard for creating and
                            distributing 3D content.”- Big tech companies are
                            coming together to try and promote a universal
                            standard for 3D modeling within VR and AR
                            experiences.
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The AOUSD (Alliance for Open Universal Scene
                            Description) is an alliance started to promote the
                            Universal Scene Description (USD) file format. This
                            format allows you to compact complex 3D scenes and
                            display them locally. It’s been called the “HTML of
                            the metaverse” by NVIDIA, and would allow a leap
                            forward in accessibility regarding 3D modeling. At
                            least, such is the expectation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Previously, a quintet of companies announced the
                            launch of this alliance, but this year two more big
                            contenders have joined. Microsoft and Sony, both big
                            in the IT, videogame and general digital industries,
                            have joined this alliance! Thus further promoting
                            this format. A universal format would allow you to
                            transfer these digital files between programs much
                            easier. For example, you wouldn’t have to use only
                            programs within the Adobe sphere, but could also
                            branch out to different programs. I’m hoping Clip
                            Studio Modeler and Blender would also support this
                            file format, for example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe this format could possibly allow me, for
                            example, to really get into 3D model creation as
                            well. It has interested me for a long time, but
                            since texturing is such a hassle and the files
                            needed are often huge, heavy and complex, it’s been
                            tough with the tools at hand. Even the beefy laptop
                            I’m writing this on (ASUS TUF A15) can hardly handle
                            an exported FBX (References the deprecated Filmbox
                            software) model being loaded in unity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The world of AR and VR is exciting, and I look
                            forward to what will develop and come from it. Maybe
                            someday I’ll be able to make something within that
                            sphere.
