          <h1>Programming Experience</h1>
          <p>
            Personally, I haven’t got a lot of experience in the world of
            coding. I’ve had my funks of curiosity, exploring pages like
            <a href="http://www.code.org">code.org</a> and similar, but I’ve
            never sunk my teeth into any sort of major projects or languages
            beyond HTML and CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this project alone has greatly encouraged me to delve
            deeper and broaden my horizons. I’ve learnt some minor things about
            JavaScript. For example, to learn how to make the buttons on the
            Blog page and how to code the script that calculates EC’s for me on
            the Dashboard. It’s been an exciting adventure and I’ve had my fun
            with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, a fact you might’ve seen on the home page, I’ve
            dipped my toes into HTML/CSS previously, with a website running on
            it’s own domain. It’s called
            <a href="https://www.suunn.nl">Suunn.nl</a> and it was my project
            over the winter of 2024. I had a lot of fun back then learning how
            to do all those things to make a primitive little place of my own.
          </p>
          <p>I do believe I’ve grown since then.</p>
          <p>
            Additionally, though I don’t know if this counts, I’ve done a few
            things with Redstone in Minecraft. Redstone in Minecraft acts like
            an electric circuit. Some people are crazy enough to build actual
            functional computers within the game, but my interest was mostly
            with automatic doors or lights that turned on when it got dark out.
            Never anything more major, and rarely anything self-made, but I used
            to follow tutorials by YouTubers such as
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatMumboJumbo">Mumbo Jumbo</a
            >. Usually I was able to understand what they had me build, and how
            the circuits worked. It was very exciting.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think there’s a lot of experience I can gain from diligently
            attending classes and keeping up with work. It’s an adventure I
            certainly look forward to. I’m going to have a lot of fun with this.
            :)
