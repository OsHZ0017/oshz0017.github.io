                        <h1>Programming Experience</h1>
                        <p>
                            Personally, I haven’t got a lot of experience in the
                            world of coding. I’ve had my funks of curiosity,
                            exploring pages like
                            <a href="http://www.code.org">code.org</a> and
                            similar, but I’ve never sunk my teeth into any sort
                            of major projects or languages beyond HTML and CSS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, this project alone has greatly encouraged
                            me to delve deeper and broaden my horizons. I’ve
                            learnt some minor things about JavaScript. For
                            example, to learn how to make the buttons on the
                            Blog page and how to code the script that calculates
                            EC’s for me on the Dashboard. It’s been an exciting
                            adventure and I’ve had my fun with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On top of that, a fact you might’ve seen on the home
                            page, I’ve dipped my toes into HTML/CSS previously,
                            with a website running on it’s own domain. It’s
                            called
                            <a href="https://www.suunn.nl">Suunn.nl</a> and it
                            was my project over the winter of 2024. I had a lot
                            of fun back then learning how to do all those things
                            to make a primitive little place of my own.
                        </p>
                        <p>I do believe I’ve grown since then.</p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, though I don’t know if this counts,
                            I’ve done a few things with Redstone in Minecraft.
                            Redstone in Minecraft acts like an electric circuit.
                            Some people are crazy enough to build actual
                            functional computers within the game, but my
                            interest was mostly with automatic doors or lights
                            that turned on when it got dark out. Never anything
                            more major, and rarely anything self-made, but I
                            used to follow tutorials by YouTubers such as
                            <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatMumboJumbo"
                                >Mumbo Jumbo</a
                            >. Usually I was able to understand what they had me
                            build, and how the circuits worked. It was very
                            exciting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think there’s a lot of experience I can gain from
                            diligently attending classes and keeping up with
                            work. It’s an adventure I certainly look forward to.
                            I’m going to have a lot of fun with this. :)
                        </p>
