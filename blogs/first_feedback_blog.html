                        <p>
                            Throughout this year and for this project, we are -
                            and will be - receiving a lot of feedback. Taking
                            that feedback and improving upon it is a major part
                            of the course and something we will learn to do.
                            Additionally, we will learn to give constructive
                            criticism, feedback you can actually work with. Here
                            is some of the feedback I have received so far.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since I came to the front of the class, I have
                            received a little feedback on my site already. I
                            will work through these comments and provide
                            motivation or insight to changes, or lack thereof.
                        </p>

                            >The website folder was nested too far into the
                            repository.</h5

                        <p>
                            I’ve fixed this by un-nesting the files on the date
                            of posting. I intend to figure out a way to sort
                            files the way I want to sort them as well as have
                            them un-nested in the repository in the future.
                            Although it’s not a main project of mine since it’s
                            not a part of official requirements and. For now,
                            everything is sorted functionally.

                            After this comment, I went and checked all my files
                            and folders within the repository to ensure no
                            capitalization was present. I’ve fixed the issue.

                            Since receiving this comment, I’ve been working very
                            hard to collect and fulfill all the page
                            requirements for the different pages on this
                            website. You can now find the FAQ filled in
                            entirely, and the blog being actively worked on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally I gave myself some feedback on a bit of
                            JavaScript I wrote, and added a feature to my
                            Dashboard that compares the amount of gained credits
                            to the NBSA to determine whether or not I’ve passed
                            it. In the future I’d like to also add a feature
                            where the Dashboard locally saves the last
                            calculated amount of EC’s, but this is no priority.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another feature I learnt about but haven't yet
                            implemented, is a CSS grid. With the current
                            timecrunch, it's not a realistic thing to implement
                            before friday. However, I do hope to add it before
                            the interviews in October happen.
