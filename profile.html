                        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                        <p>
                            My name is Mika, I am a 21 year old guy and have
                            been living in Zeeland for the majority of my
                            life.<br />I live with both my parents, and a
                            younger sibling. There is a year and a half between
                            her and me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to education, I've completed the Dutch
                            High School system and have been granted my "HAVO"
                            diploma. This is more or less defined as "Senior
                            General Secondary Education", though I have to admit
                            I haven't the faintest as to what that means
                            exactly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I originally intended to go to an Art Academy, but
                            was turned away wherever I applied. It's still a
                            dream but not a realistic one. I decided to go into
                            ICT mainly because the magic of computer coding has
                            always enticed me, but also perhaps because it's
                            still a better option than politics.

                            I have a job delivering newspapers, which I
                            dilligently fufill every morning with the exception
                            of Sundays.

                                I mainly have interest in the rythm game OSU!,
                                but occasionally play factory builders like
                                Shapez.io and simpler games such as Minecraft,
                                too. I also have a VR headset which I enjoy
                                using a lot, mainly for Beat Saber and VRChat.

                                LARP stands for "Live Action RolePlay" and is a
                                genre with wild variety. The part I most like
                                about it is the improv acting involved. Sadly I
                                haven't been able to participate in any official
                                events yet.

                                You'll likely see me doodle in class. I enjoy

                        <h4>Some further HTML projects</h4>
                        <p>Outside of coding for school, I occasionally meddle with html and css for a website called <a href="https://toyhou.se/">"Toyhou.se"</a>. <br>
                        This is a website that allows you to list original characters you've made, and display/collect art and information about them. Additionally, you can customize their pages with custom HTML and CSS!<br>
                        The Toyhouse website is built on a grid that I don't know the layout of yet, but is still very neat to work with in my personal opinion.</p>
                        <p>The first project I made on this was for a character named <a href="https://toyhou.se/28603335.crowbar">Crowbar</a>, the code for his layout was taken from someone else but it had a LOT of inline CSS.<br>
                        I spent a day taking out all the inline CSS and rebuilding the page with a proper backend, as well as changing the theming to be more in line with the videogame <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic">Pathologic</a>.<br>
                        Now he's looking much fancier, and I made a bunch of other people very happy with this code, too.</p>
