                        <p>If possible, I would like to add more scripts to this website.<br>
                        Mainly a scrip to automate the navigation bar, but also just in general to make things work smarter.<br>
                        I also intend to rewrite the script behind the dashboard calculations. It works, but I believe it can be made smarter and more efficient.<br>
                        Also, don't tell anyone, but it's a little broken right now. I will repair it when I can find some mental space to, but repairing it comes with upgrading it, too.</p>

                            I think I am ready to be a part of this programme.
                            To learn more about the things that make me curious
                            and actually learn to understand and create in this
                            field of work.

                        <p>
                            From as young as I have been aware of computers, I
                            have been curious about how their internal
                            mechanisms function. As a younger child we did not
                            exactly have a computer at home on which I was
                            allowed to experiment, but I remember begging my
                            father to let me install minecraft mods. He did,
                            however, let me do classes and projects on
                            <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He never let me install those mods though, too
                            afraid I would permanently damage something. Which
                            honestly, I would have.

                            Now that I have become older and have my own money
                            and a frontal lobe more capable of reasonable
                            decisions, I am allowed to start and experiment. I
                            am excited to learn things I did not know before,
                            and I look forward an incredible amount to learning
                            all about these languages that I have heard of, but
                            never learnt to read.

                        <p>
                            I especially look forward to learning JavaScript.
                            Perhaps in the future I will be creating what I was
                            so curious about, a Minecraft mod! If ever I come up
                            with an idea decent enough.

                            I hope all of you are just as excited as I am to go
                            into this year and start learning!

                        <h3>Intrinsic Motivation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Though, if you find yourself even
                            <strong>more</strong> curious about my actual
                            motivation for the programme, here is a little
                            exercise we were offered in Lecture. I will be
                            answering "Why ICT?" a few times.
                        </p>
                        <h5>So, Why ICT?</h5>
                        <p
                            >Because computers have always seemed interesting to
                            me.</p
                        >
                        <h5>But why do computers seem interesting?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Because they seem magic, but actually work on logic
                            and I want to learn to understand that.
                        </p>
                        <h5>But why do you want to understand that logic?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Because not very many people are able to, and I
                            would feel really cool if I could.
                        </p>
                        <h5>But why would it make you feel cool?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Because I would feel really proud of myself for
                            learning something so complex. It would be like
                            speaking another language to me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have previously worked on
                            <a href="https://suunn.nl"> a website</a> before,
                            though the intention of this prevous site was to
                            look both retro and intentionally awful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I cannot claim I have grown a
                            <strong>lot</strong> since then, but maybe a little?
