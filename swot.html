          <h1>SWOT analysis</h1>
          <p>
            We all had to fill in a SWOT analysis as a part of the application
            process. A SWOT analysis works you through a series of questions to
            determine your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.
            This allows you to figure out in what regards you are already very strong and in
            what regards you could grow to improve.
          </p>
          <h5>I have edited my answers into a cohesive text.</h5>
          <p>
            Some of my strengths are that I am curious and unafraid to dive into
            endeavors that intrigue me. If something manages to grab my
            interest, I will pour my heart soul and full energy into it, until
            something occurs to divert that focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if I lose my interest, my energy will become incredibly
            distracted and possibly apathetic towards the subject. A definitive
            weakness of mine is being unable to find interest or curiosity in a
            specific subject and falling prey to boredom, disinterest and/or
            annoyance. It takes a lot of energy to finish things I don't really
            want to do. For example, it took forever to go sit down to write
            this blog, simply because I didn't feel like it.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are definitely a lot of opportunities for growth in those regards,
            especially the focus, I want to be better at all of that. I want to
            teach myself how to find the energy to do things even when they
            aren’t new and shiny. If I manage to overcome that hurdle I truly do
            believe I can learn a lot in this course and create things I can be
            proud of.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, I believe my biggest threat would be overloading
            myself and not setting boundaries, and taking on too many cool projects
            but ignoring basic requirements. That’s why writing these blogs was
            left for last, and why it’s a bit of a pitfall.
          </p>
          <h5>All in all,</h5>
          <p>
            I am perfectly human with room for growth, and hope I do grow over
            the course of the four years I will spend in this program. I
            hope to become a diligent student.
