          <h1>SWOT analysis</h1>
          <p>
            We all had to fill in a SWOT analysis as a part of the application
            process. A SWOT analysis works you through a series of questions to
            determine your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.
            This allows you to figure out in what regards you’re already and in
            what regards you could grow to improve.
          </p>
            <h5>I’ve edited my answers into a cohesive text.</h5>
            <p>
              Some of my strengths are that I’m curious and unafraid to dive
              into endeavors that intrigue me. If something manages to grab my
              interest, I will pour my heart soul and full energy into it until
              something occurs to divert that focus.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if I lose my interest, my energy will become incredibly
              distracted and possibly apathetic towards the subject. A
              definitive weakness of mine is being unable to find interest or
              curiosity in a specific subject and falling prey to boredom,
              disinterest and/or annoyance. It takes a LOT of energy to finish
              things I don’t really want to do. For example, it took forever to
              go sit down to write this blog, simply because I didn’t feel like
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Theres definitely a lot of opportunity for growth in those
              regards, especially the focus, I want to be better at all of that.
              I want to teach myself how to find the energy to do things even
              when they aren’t new and shiny. If I manage to overcome that
              hurdle I truly do believe I can learn a lot in this course and
              create things I can be proud of.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other side I believe my biggest threat would be overloading
              myself, not setting boundaries, and taking on too many cool
              projects but ignoring basic requirements. That’s why writing these
              blogs was left for last, and why it’s a bit of a pitfall.
            </p>
            <h5>All in all,</h5>
            <p>
              I am perfectly human with room for growth, and hope I do grow over
              the course of the four years I’ll hopefully spend in this program.
              I hope to become a diligent student.
