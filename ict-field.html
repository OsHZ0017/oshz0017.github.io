          <h1>A note on AOUSD</h1>
          <h5 style="font-size: medium">
            ”Last year, Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, and NVIDIA announced the
            Alliance for OpenUSD, an organization to advance and proliferate the
            USD file format as the future standard for creating and distributing
            3D content.”- Big tech companies are coming together to try and
            promote a universal standard for 3D modeling within VR and AR
            experiences.
          </h5>
          <p>
            The AOUSD (Alliance for Open Universal Scene Description) is an
            alliance started to promote the Universal Scene Description (USD)
            file format. This format allows you to compact complex 3D scenes and
            display them locally. It’s been called the “HTML of the metaverse”
            by NVIDIA, and would allow a leap forward in accessibility regarding
            3D modeling. At least, such is the expectation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, a quintet of companies announced the launch of this
            alliance, but this year two more big contenders have joined.
            Microsoft and Sony, both big in the IT, videogame and general
            digital industries, have joined this alliance! Thus further
            promoting this format. A universal format would allow you to
            transfer these digital files between programs much easier. For
            example, you wouldn’t have to use only programs within the Adobe
            sphere, but could also branch out to different programs. I’m hoping
            Clip Studio Modeler and Blender would also support this file format,
            for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe this format could possibly allow me, for example, to
            really get into 3D model creation as well. It has interested me for
            a long time, but since texturing is such a hassle and the files
            needed are often huge, heavy and complex, it’s been tough with the
            tools at hand. Even the beefy laptop I’m writing this on (ASUS TUF
            A15) can hardly handle an exported FBX (References the deprecated
            Filmbox software) model being loaded in unity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world of AR and VR is exciting, and I look forward to what will
            develop and come from it. Maybe someday I’ll be able to make
            something within that sphere.
